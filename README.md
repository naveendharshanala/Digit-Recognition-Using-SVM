# Digit-Recognition-Using-SVM

Handwritten Digit Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM): I developed a classification model to accurately recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel values. This project involved data collection, preprocessing, and implementing SVM algorithms for a 10-class classification problem. I optimized model parameters and evaluated performance, gaining hands-on experience in machine learning techniques.
